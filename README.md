# Testing with Jasmine in a Feed Reader

## Project Overview

The Udacity overview for this project states:
"In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing,
they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started
writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start
their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test
suite. That's where you come in."

## Instructions

To run the feed reader tests, go to the bottom of the page and click on
the test that you would like to review, or run all tests
at once.

## Installation

Download the Feed Reader project from github: https://github.com/Zundanus/feedreader.git

Open the index.html to run the Feed Reader Tests.
